  <p>What is HTML by MDN:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
    web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within
    a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
    tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
    understanding of HTML and its functions.
